# Recipe-Converter
Divide your recipes easily by whatever number you wish. 

The app takes a recipe as input in the format :
(quantity) (metric) (ingredient name)
and then accepts a number from the user by which they wish to divide the recipe.
After diving the recipe, it converts the decimals into cooking fractions for tablespoon, teaspoon and cup measurements.
